# Hi, I'm Farhaan Qazi

Data Analyst with a Master's in Data Science and a passion for solving real-world problems through data. I blend analytics, machine learning, and storytelling to uncover insights that drive smarter decisions.

I enjoy working across SQL, Python, and Power BI to make sense of data â€” whether itâ€™s forecasting trends, streamlining processes, or building intuitive dashboards that tell a story.
